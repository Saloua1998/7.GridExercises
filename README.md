# GridExercises

# Time Spend(1H)

# Description

In this project I will make different layout with css Grid so I understand this layout form better and can work with it. I will build 5 different layouts:

- Pancake Stack
- Simple 12 columns Grid Layout
- A Responsive Layout with and without grid-template-areas
- A Responsive Layout without media Queries in CSS Grid
- A 12 x 12 Chess Grid with CSS Grid

Exercises are from: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/learn-css-grid-by-building-5-layouts/

# Learned:

- body > \*: Selects all the children of body. This way I can give them all a red border
- grid-column: 2 / span 4; (This column will be spread from column 2 to 6, only if the parent has grid-template-columns: repeat((6 or more), 1fr);)

# Thoughts after project

It was a tough project, but it was well worth it. I've learned how to use different layouts like flex and grid. I made a different kind of navbar than I usely do.
